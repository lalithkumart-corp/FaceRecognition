Created this prj by learning from this reference https://towardsdatascience.com/real-time-face-recognition-an-end-to-end-project-b738bb0f7348



=== First of all, Downloaded the pre-requirements
- Installed the "OpenCV" in machine (below command). https://docs.opencv.org/4.x/d2/de6/tutorial_py_setup_in_ubuntu.html
    $ sudo apt-get install python3-opencv 

=== I Played with 2 demo code 
- demo_cameraTest.py 
- demo_faceDetection.py


=== Started Project
- face_dataset.py
    It is used to Gather the Pictures (count 30) and store in folder "dataset"
    It will prompt for the userId. Give some valid id for a user. EX: 4

- face_trainer.py
    It is used to train the OpenCV recognizer. It takes the pictures from Dataset folder, and trains and as a result, creates a "trainer.yml"

- face_recognition.py
    Live action now. So, this script will open up the camera, and recognizes the face, and shows correct name.
    This script will find the user Id correctly. Ex: 4

Folder "Cascades" 
- haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml
    This is a algorithm we use for face detection

=== requirements.txt
- Generated the requirements file by running below command
   $ pip3 freeze > requirements.txt
